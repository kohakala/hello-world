# hello-world
Ideas, un-polished concepts,  discussion and fun.
I am a formless blob of matter screaming internally with terror, my existence mal-formed and irreducibly complex. The angry sun in the sky turns a shade of blue every hour, paling into light purple so painfully bright my brain would shriek if it was possessed of organs capable of sound.

Adding something fun down here.

Adding even more fun. Gosh we have a lot of fun!
